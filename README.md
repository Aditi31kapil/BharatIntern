# Project Portfolio

## Overview
This project portfolio showcases two machine learning projects I've developed, focusing on spam classification and cat vs. dog classification. Both projects were implemented using Python libraries and my foundational knowledge of data analysis. Additionally, I utilized Google Colab for one of the tasks, which expanded my understanding of alternative methods for writing and deploying code.Also I used Kaggle which is a  data science competition platform and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners.It provides reliable and trusted data.

## Projects

1. **Spam Classification**
   - **Description:** This project involved developing a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or non-spam. I employed various Python libraries, such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy`, to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
   - **Techniques Used:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.
   - **Outcome:** The final model achieved an accuracy of 92% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails.

2. **Cat vs. Dog Classification**
   - **Description:** In this project, I built a computer vision model to classify images as either depicting a cat or a dog. I utilized popular deep learning libraries like `TensorFlow` and `Keras` to develop and train the model.
   - **Techniques Used:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.
   - **Outcome:** The final model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set, showcasing its ability to accurately classify cat and dog images.

## Google Colab Utilization
For one of the tasks, I leveraged Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment, to write and deploy the code. Using Google Colab expanded my knowledge of alternative methods for writing and deploying code, as it provided a convenient platform to access powerful computing resources and collaborate on the project.

## Conclusion
This project portfolio demonstrates my ability to tackle various machine learning tasks, from spam classification to cat vs. dog classification. I've showcased my proficiency in utilizing Python libraries, applying data analysis techniques, and exploring alternative development environments like Google Colab. These projects have not only helped me develop my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the machine learning field.
